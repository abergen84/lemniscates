#Lemniscates - A Drawing Game

##Overview

We all loved to draw growing up. Forget smartphones, laptops, and 
PCs. From Etch A Sketch to actual crayons, the young you
stayed super busy with some classic entertainment. I've created a twist on a classic 
and simple drawing game with Lemniscates. Think of what you want to draw, create it, 
save it, and share it with the world. Boost your way up on the rankings by getting
the most likes, and have people share their thoughts with a real-time comment system.
Each day, the drawing with the most number of likes wins for some easy bragging rights.
